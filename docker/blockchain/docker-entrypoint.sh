# The entry point for the blockchain container which starts the local
# Ethereum blockchain through Embark. The blockchain data resides on the host,
# in a directory mapped to /blockchain in the container.

# On first run the directory is created and several blocks are mined to fund
# the main account. That takes some time.

# When running on Windows with the files mapped from an NTFS volume, the first
# two runs run into an error because of filesystem issues:
# Fatal: blockchain db err: fsync: invalid argument
# This is worked  around the dumb way by starting three times. In each of the
# first two tries  a part of the blockchain data structure is created
# successfully, which makes it possible for the third run onwards to be
# successful. Any runs using the same blockchain structure after that are
# successful.

# TODO: parameterize environment (development, staging, production)
